environment
===========

Basic way to set up the environment in Unix.  Useful if you have to
work on different projects with different requirements.

After cloning to $HOME/.environment, create the following links.

.bash_logout -> $HOME/.environment/logout
.bashrc -> $HOME/.environment/environment
.profile -> $HOME/.environment/login
